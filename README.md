# XBreaker
**It is a simple 2D block breaker game with multiple levels built with Godot 4.4**
## How to play
Start the game and choose your desired level to play. The ball is attached to the paddle. Press the spacebar to move the paddle from the ball, then hit the ball with the paddle to start moving. The game is built to describe physics â€” if you do not hit the ball, it will start moving.
